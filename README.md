# Text Summarization

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages transformer models to generate concise and accurate summaries of given texts.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **Transformer Models**: Utilize pre-trained transformer models for text summarization.
- **Customizable Summarization**: Allows for adjustments in summary length and detail.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement evaluation metrics like ROUGE to assess summary quality.
- **Data Processing**: Includes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare text data.
